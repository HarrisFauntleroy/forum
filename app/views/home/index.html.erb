    <p>Just an update to let everyone know that the existing backlog of
      registrations has been processed. A handful of older registrations which
      had been caught by an errant spam filter have also been processed.
      Apologies for any delays.

      For everyone's convenience, I've added some contact information to the
      menu on the left side of the site. Please don't hesitate to use it if
      you're experiencing any difficulty signing in or getting registered.</p>

    <p>4hv.org is back up and running, after several hours of downtime due to a
      hardware failure. Apologies for the inconvenience. The problem now
      appears to be fully resolved, so there's no expectation of further
      downtime in the near future. Carry on!</p>
